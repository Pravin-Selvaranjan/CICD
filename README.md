# CICD Pipelines (Continuous intergration (CI), Continuous Delivery/Deployment(CD))

A CI/CD pipeline automates your software delivery process. The pipeline builds code, runs tests (CI), and safely deploys a new version of the application (CD).

Automated pipelines remove manual errors, provide standardized feedback loops to developers, and enable fast product iterations.


## CI 

- CI, short for Continuous Integration, is a software development practice in which all developers merge code changes in a central repository multiple times a day.
- With CI, each change in code triggers an automated build-and-test sequence for the given project, providing feedback to the developer(s) who made the change.
  

## CD 

- CD stands for Continuous Delivery, which on top of Continuous Integration adds the practice of automating the entire software release process.
- Continuous Delivery includes infrastructure provisioning and deployment, which may be manual and consist of multiple stages. Whatâ€™s important is that all these processes are fully automated, with each run fully logged and visible to the entire team.

## Webhooks

- A webhook delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately. Unlike typical APIs where you would need to poll for data very frequently in order to get it in real-time. 
- Webhooks are one way that apps can send automated messages or information to other apps. It's how PayPal tells your accounting app when your clients pay you, how Twilio routes phone calls to your number, and how WooCommerce can notify you about new orders in Slack.


## Jenkins

- Jenkins is an open-source Continuous Integration server written in Java for orchestrating a chain of actions to achieve the Continuous Integration process in an automated fashion.
- Jenkins is a widely used application around the world that has around 300k installations and growing day by day. By using Jenkins, software companies can accelerate their software development process, as Jenkins can automate build and test at a rapid rate.
